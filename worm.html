    <h3>Worms target vulnerabilities in operating systems to install themselves into networks. They may gain access in several ways: through backdoors built into software, through unintentional software vulnerabilities, or through flash drives. Once in place, worms can be used by malicious actors to launch DDoS attacks, steal sensitive data, or conduct ransomware attacks.</h3>
    <h1><b>Worm Example:</b></h1>
    <h3>Stuxnet was probably developed by the US and Israeli intelligence forces with the intent of setting back Iran’s nuclear program. It was introduced into Iran’s environment through a flash drive. Because the environment was air-gapped, its creators never thought Stuxnet would escape its target’s network — but it did. Once in the wild, Stuxnet spread aggressively but did little damage, since its only function was to interfere with industrial controllers that managed the uranium enrichment process.
