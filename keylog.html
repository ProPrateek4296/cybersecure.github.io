     <h1>What is 'KEYLOGGER'<b>?</b></h1>
</head>
<body>
    <h3>A keylogger is a type of spyware that monitors user activity. Keyloggers have legitimate uses; businesses can use them to monitor employee activity and families may use them to keep track of children’s online behaviors.
         <br>
        However, when installed for malicious purposes, keyloggers can be used to steal password data, banking information and other sensitive information. Keyloggers can be inserted into a system through phishing, social engineering or malicious downloads.</h3>
    <h1><b>Keylogger Example:</b></h1>
    <h3>A keylogger called Olympic Vision has been used to target US, Middle Eastern and Asian businessmen for business email compromise (BEC) attacks. Olympic Vision uses spear-phishing and social engineering techniques to infect its targets’ systems in order to steal sensitive data and spy on business transactions. The keylogger is not sophisticated, but it’s available on the black market for $25 so it’s highly accessible to malicious actors.
