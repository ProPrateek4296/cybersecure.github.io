        <h3>Malware is malicious software that enables unauthorized access to networks for purposes of theft, sabotage, or espionage. There are many types of malware,
             and many attacks use a combination of several types to achieve their goals.
            <br>
            Malware is usually introduced into a network through phishing, malicious attachments, or malicious downloads, but it may gain access through social engineering or flash drives as well.
