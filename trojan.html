<body>
    <h3>A Trojan disguises itself as desirable code or software. Once downloaded by unsuspecting users, the Trojan can take control of victimsâ€™ systems for malicious purposes. Trojans may hide in games, apps, or even software patches, or they may be embedded in attachments included in phishing emails.</h3>
    <h1><b>Trojan Example:</b></h1>
    <h3>Emotet is a sophisticated banking trojan that has been around since 2014. It is hard to fight Emotet because it evades signature-based detection, is persistent, and includes spreader modules that help it propagate. The trojan is so widespread that it is the subject of a US Department of Homeland Security alert, which notes that Emotet has cost state, local, tribal and territorial governments up to $1 million per incident to remediate.
